# DSGE Model Documentation Roadmap

This document outlines the current state of documentation and identifies areas that need further development.

## Completed Documentation

1. **README.md**
   - Project overview
   - Comprehensive installation instructions
   - Directory structure
   - Quick start guide
   - Core components
   - Implementation strategy
   - Technology stack
   - Workflow diagrams

2. **USAGE_GUIDE.md**
   - Executive summary
   - Introduction (DSGE models, Smets-Wouters model, implementation architecture)
   - Installation and setup
   - Core concepts (configuration system, model structure, solution methods, data management)
   - Working with the model (basic simulation, data processing, model estimation, forecasting)

3. **EXAMPLE_FILES.md**
   - Detailed documentation for all planned example scripts
   - Usage instructions
   - Implementation details
   - Expected outputs

## Documentation To Be Completed

The following sections of the USAGE_GUIDE.md need to be expanded or completed:

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Model extensions (financial frictions, open economy, fiscal policy)
   - Custom solution methods
   - Performance optimization
   - External data integration

2. **API Reference**
   - Configuration API
   - Model API
   - Solution API
   - Data API
   - Estimation API
   - Analysis API
   - Visualization API

3. **Tutorials and Case Studies**
   - Replicating Smets-Wouters (2007)
   - Financial crisis analysis
   - Policy simulation

4. **Troubleshooting and FAQs**
   - Common issues
   - Performance problems
   - Numerical stability

5. **Appendices and References**
   - Mathematical derivations
   - Bibliography
   - Further reading

## Implementation Roadmap

The following tasks are recommended for completing the documentation and implementation:

1. **Complete USAGE_GUIDE.md**
   - Add remaining sections listed above
   - Add more detailed examples and use cases
   - Include additional visualizations and diagrams

2. **Implement Example Scripts**
   - Switch to Code mode to implement all example scripts documented in EXAMPLE_FILES.md
   - Ensure each example has proper error handling and comments
   - Verify that examples work with the existing codebase

3. **Additional Documentation**
   - Create Sphinx or MkDocs setup for API documentation
   - Create documentation for developers who want to extend the system
   - Add docstrings to all functions and classes for auto-documentation

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Create test cases for each component
   - Add validation against published results
   - Create benchmarks for performance comparisons
